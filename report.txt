3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Autocomplete Term): The biggest issue I had with this problem was
   that I originally started to do string comparisons my self by turning the
   string into character arrays and finding the sum of the integer value for 
   each character. I was not getting the correct answers so I did a research 
   online about string comparisons and I found out that string objects have a 
   built in function called compareTo() which will do that comparison for me.

   Problem 2 (Binary Search Deluxe): For this problem I modified the sample 
   binary search code that was found in the text book. Getting an occurence in 
   array was easy but the biggest issue I had was that I was obtaining the first
   and the last occurence of term. I realized for the left side I would have to 
   continue checking that side until I got to index 0 and for the right I  would
   have to check until I got to the end of the end of the array.

   Problem 3 (Autocomplete): For this problem I had to refer back to my analysis
   of algorithms presentation to understand how I should complete this problem. 
   I initially started off doing another binary search between the lowest index 
   and the highest index and I was not getting all terms I needed. After looking
   at the performance requirements again for this problem which is logN + MlogM
   , I realized that I can use loop to iterate through the lowest and hightest 
   index.
   
4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   ----               ------       -------------

   I did not receive any help for this project outstide doing researches online
   and the text book for clarification on a few different methods.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

    I think this is probably my first time using binary search and I am very 
    impressed with the efficiency of it when it comes to large arrays. So far I
    enjoyed doing this project the most because it was interesting learning how 
    autocomplete actually works. Especially because we use this feature in our
    everyday lives either on our phones or on our computers.
